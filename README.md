# Matplotlib Practice - Learning Journey
This repository contains my hands-on practice with Matplotlib using Jupyter Notebook.

Today, I focused on understanding how data visualization works in Python. I explored basic plotting techniques such as line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, titles, labels, and grid customization. I also practiced modifying figure size, colors, legends, and styling to better understand how visualization improves data interpretation.

This notebook is part of my continuous learning journey in Machine Learning and Data Science. My goal is not just to learn the theory, but to build practical skills by experimenting and documenting everything I study.

Tools Used:

-Python

-Matplotlib

-Pillow

-Jupyter Notebook


I will continue updating this repository as I learn more advanced visualization techniques.
